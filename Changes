	- Allow multiple comment keys of the same type for Vorbis comments.

	- Skip ID3 tags if they exist.

	- Ogg tag parser was badly broken and would fail if the amount of tag

	  routine based on code from Image::ExifTool::Vorbis.  Also fixed the
	  cover art code as it was also broken: from Andy Grundman
